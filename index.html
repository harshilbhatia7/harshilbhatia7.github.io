        <h4>Dodge Bird- Inspired by Flappy Bird</h4>
      </header>
      <p>This game has been made using Kaboom.js and is inspired from the game Flappy Bird. Using the original concept
        of the game, many changes have been made to the game, like theming, multiple difficulty modes- players are
        allowed to play three different levels which all have varying speeds of objects approaching and thus react
        accordingly. This project helped me get introduced to game development, and using this library also helped
        improve my knowledge of JavaScript.</p>

        <h4>Recipe Box- A collection of multi-cultural recipes</h4>
      </header>
      <p>This website has been made using React, and making this project helped me gain understanding and experience in
        using React-router-dom. We can search for different types of recipes, see trending and selected reipes, and even
        select recipes according to those of different cultures of our world. Making this project and facing some issues
        helped me improve my knowledge of React.</p>
